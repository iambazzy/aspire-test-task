# Steps to run 

> After cloning the repo navigate to root folder of the project and run:

```
npm i 
```
> This will install the required dependencies. After the installation process is finished. Run:

```
npm run serve
```

> This will get the project up and running on `localhost:<port_number>`. Port number here is `8080` by default but if for some reason that port is already taken it will start it on some other port number like `8081, 8082 etc.`
